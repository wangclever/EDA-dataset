**General information**

Through the field study, we totally selected EDA signals of eight subjects in a five-days travel. And each of them were asked to wear Empatica E4 during the whole day.

**Data format**

- 'unix_time': The intitial time format expressed by Empatica E4.

- 'second_time': Beijing time in milliseconds corresponding to the unix timestamp.

- 'tourism_experience':  tourism experiences which contains attraction attributes and individual activities., in two fields:

- 'attraction_name': The names of attractions subjects visited.

- 'weather': Real-time weather conditions during the travel, in two fields:
  1. Sunny
  2. Cloudy

- 'EDA': Raw sensor data from Empatica E4 expressed as microsiemens (Î¼S) in 4Hz, while the initial time of the session  expressed as unix timestamp in UTC.

- 'ID': The acronym of eight subjects

- 'date': The number of days in the field study (from 1 to 5).
