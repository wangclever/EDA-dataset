Description of example data in paper 'Emotional fluctuations under different tourism experiences: An exploratory electrodermal activity analysis'
======

**1. General information**

Through a field study, we captured EDA signals of eight participants by Empatica E4 during a five-days travel. Totally, the raw EDA data records are 659931. After great efforts of data cleaning, which includes Butterworth filtering, down-sampling and so on, the final cleaned data set consists of 8566 records. To help the review process, we provide examples of data we used in paper **'Emotional fluctuations under different tourism experiences: An exploratory electrodermal activity analysis'**. 

**2. Data structure**
 
The data set is organised with two example data: raw data set and cleaned data set. Both are from the same participants and in the same period.

2.1. raw data set

Which is sampled in 4Hz by Empatica E4.
    
- 'date': The number of days in the field study (from 1 to 5).
    
- 'time': Beijing time in millisecond corresponding to the Unix timestamp expressed by Empatica E4.
    
- 'EDA': Raw sensor data from Empatica E4 expressed as microsiemens (Î¼S) in 4Hz, while the initial time of the session expressed as Unix timestamp in UTC.
    
2.2. cleaned data set
    
Which is obtained after data cleaning and merged with manually recorded information corresponding to participants' visiting time. 
    
- 'date': The number of days in the field study (from 1 to 5).
    
- 'new_time': Recoded time based on the order in which the raw data was recorded (unit: minute).
    
- 'experience': Recorded of tourism experiences grouped by attractions and tourists' activities, in two types:
    
> - Natural experience (includes natural scenery, visiting insects & animals).
> - Social experience (includes culture scenery, shopping).

- 'attra_type': Attraction types, in four types:

> - Natural scenery
> - Visiting insects & animals
> - Culture scenery
> - Shopping

- 'attra_name': Records of attraction names that participants visited in different time.

- 'weather': Records of real-time weather conditions during the travel, in two types:

> - Sunny
> - Cloudy

- 'emotion': Data from raw EDA signals that has been cleaned and pre-processed.
